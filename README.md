# React Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of small React projects and components I’ve built while learning and practicing **React.js**.

Each folder in this repo is a standalone project that focuses on a specific concept or feature in React, such as hooks, component composition, and real-world API integration.

## 📁 Projects

- **currency converter**  
  A simple app that fetches live exchange rates using the Frankfurter API and converts between currencies using `useState` and `useEffect`.

- **accordion**  
  A basic accordion UI component to toggle visibility of content — built with controlled component patterns and simple state management.

- **Text Expander Component**  
  A reusable component that displays truncated text and expands/collapses on click — great for articles or previews.
